# Slides Directory

If you are looking at this page in GitHub, you will see a number of *html* files which comprise each week's presentation. These are actually **markdown** files and not html. Markdown is great, if you want to look at the slides as raw text and also see version changes. But if you are hoping to view them in presentation mode, you need to visit the web view accessible from links below.

## Slides

1. [Introduction](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week01.html) - What's this class about? ([slide links](#week1-slide-links))

2. [HCI Research Methodologies - Experimentation) ](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week02.html) - Covers a range of methodologies, but focuses on how to read scientific papers. ([slide links](#week2-slide-links))

3. [HCI Research Methodologies - Ethnography and Survey](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week03.html) - Introduces two more very useful methodologies you will encounter in reading. ([slide links](#week3-slide-links))

4. [How do we know what we see?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week04.html) - Introduction to visual perception. Perception is de-centralized and driven by both bottom-up and top-down proecsses. ([slide links](#week4-slide-links))

5. [How do we know about things?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week05.html) - Builds on the previous week and towards how we think in terms of concepts and associate information multimodally. We learn what role background knowledge plays in perception. ([slide links](#week5-slide-links))

6. [How do we think?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week06.html) Kahneman discusses the implication of two systems for thinking where one is fast and intuitive, and the other slow and thoughtful. ([slide links](#week6-slide-links))

7. [How do emotions affect belief?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week07.html) Emotions and feelings play an important role in the shape of our beliefs and thoughts. ([slide links](#week7-slide-links))

8. [How do we understand?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week08.html) Language is form of joint action and is, therefore, social. When we see it from this perspective, we can better account for processes concerned with the prevention, detection and repair of error in dialogue. ([slide links](#week8-slide-links))

9. [How do people make decisions when they are uncertain?](https://ub-idia640-2016.github.io/slides/week09.html) People believe they have complete control over choices they make. This is surprisingly not the case. ([slide links](#week9-slide-links))
