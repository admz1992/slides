# Review

- Smart brains are lazy
- We are pattern matchers
- 98% of brain activity supports unconscious processes
- Thinking is only a limited part of what we do
- Emotion drives thought
- To reduce effort, we leverage habits
- We understand interactions as dialogue - dialogue is a joint activity
- We build common ground by exchanging thoughts
- There are costs to common ground, so we try to minimize collaborative effort

"The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is subjective and often flawed." (Wikipedia)

Based on statistical analyses, the Oakland A's considered that traditional statistics might be flawed and began to look for predictors of player performance that were under-valued by the market.

Question of similarity easier than liklihood (estimations off base rates.

Kahneman (as Tversky had passed away) - Nobel prize in 2002 "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty". They lay the foundation for a new field of research known as behavior economics, which even today is generating new insights into human behavior in a myriad of contexts.

"What is perhaps surprising is the failure of people to infer from lifelong experience such fundamental statistical rules as regression toward the mean, or the effect of sample size on sampling validity...Statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because the relevant instances are not coded appropriately." p. 1130

"The lack of an appropriate code also explains why people usually do not detect the biases in their judgments of probability." p. 1130

In their second work on prospect theory, K&A critique traditional utilitarian models of decisions factoring in certain tendencies in behavior.

Which is more likely? Death by accident or death by diabetes? At what ratio?

-Death by accidents was judged to be more than 300 times more likely than death by diabetes, but the true ratio was 1:4

Process of judging frequency by "the ease of which instances come to mind."

"Estimates of deaths warped by media coverage which is biased toward novelty and poignancy."

"Almost a direct representation of activation of ideas in associative memory."

"Ease at which ideas of various risk that come to mind are inextricably linked to emotional reactions."

Where fear is a response to a present threat, anxiety is a more complex and highly manipulable response to something one anticipates might be a threat in the future. "It is a worry about something that hasn't happened and may never happen," says LeDoux. It is an experience of uncertainty.

And that uncertainty is the exact lever that politicians regularly use to try to influence your behavior.

There are two particular ways, among many, in which living with these anxieties month after month can change your brain.

The first: "If you look at the cellular level of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus" – the thinking and memory-forming parts of the brain – "when you're living under constant states of fear and anxiety, you can actually see them shutting down," says Justin Moscarello, who works in LeDoux's lab. "They shrink. They wither. And the amygdala actually gets bigger."

The second way: Anxiety can turn to fear. Part of threat detection is learning, and the brain can create a false correlation when a stimulus that's not actually a threat activates the body's threat-response system.

User research to help guard against user anxiety.

# Representativeness and availability in UX?

"Availability biases leads to poor design decisions because they are based on single, potentially skewed, examples."

https://www.cooper.com/journal/2010/7/combating_availability_bias

- Focus landing page design and copy on the problems your product solves, not what it does. “Get dinner delivered faster” is better than “Fast food delivery online.”

- Cut irrelevant info from your design. Every irrelevant message dilutes the relevant ones.

# Anchoring - Setting a reference point

"Consideration of a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity"

???

System 1 - priming
- Selective activation of compatible memories (Is the annual mean temp in Germany higher or lower than 68 deg/41 deg). Easier to recognize either words associated with summer or winter.

System 2 - Information retrieved by memory.
- People adjust less when mental resources are depleted
- Affected by actions such as head nods / shakes

Reference point sets the measure by which we judge
We understand relative differences by impact (900-1000 vs 100-200)

# Loss aversion

### You are offered a gamble on the toss of a coin. If the coin shows tails, you lose $ 100. If the coin shows heads, you win $ 150. Is this gamble attractive? Would you accept it?

???

We're designed to give more attention faster to bad things: we're highly sensitive to threats.

This works even for bad words (war, crime) and bad faces. Bad feedback has more impact that good. Good interactions are about avoiding the negative.

Asymmetry of intensity to avoid losses.

# Certainty


???

Decision makers tend to prefer the sure thing over the gamble (they are risk averse) when the outcomes are good. They tend to reject the sure thing and accept the gamble (they are risk seeking) when both outcomes are negative.

# Framing effect

Support simplification by disregarding any element common to both options.

Collaborative filtering is a solution to a choice architecture problem - it simplifies, saves cognitive resources and search costs, thus making choice easier.

# Fourfold pattern

???

Faced with a low probability of a gain, people buy lottery tickets.

 Faced with a low probability of a loss, we buy insurance.

 We are risk averse when we have a high probability of a gain — we would rather accept a slightly low salary than risk not getting (or continuing) a job.

 No good options - gamble.

# Defaults and framing

???

(2003 study) Since 1995, more than 45,000 people in the United States have died waiting for a suitable donor organ.

1993 Gallup poll showed that 85% of Americans approve of organ donation.
- Less half had made a decision about donating
- 28% granted permission by signing a donor card.

This pattern repeated in several other countries.

# A puzzle for designers (Johnson)

.center[Why when people are risk averse and the cost low, but impact large, would they not purchase back-up and virus protection?]

As Johnson mentions, statistics from 2012 indicate that the majority of users do as Prospect theory predicts (17% of PCs have no virus protection; 31% of personal computers have lost all of their files). Nonetheless, how can designers nudge users even further.
