# Review: Working memory

.center[![:scale 70%](images/baddeley.png)]

*"a temporary storage system under attentional control that underpins our capacity for complex thought"* (Baddeley,2007, p.1)

**Replaces what was previously called short-term memory**

???
.1 seconds - a few seconds. Support ongoing cognitive work. Temporary grouping where connections are formed between the visual and non-visual. The most important non-visual links are help in WM.

Visual chunks bind to non-visual. Image mind to phrases. They also bind to action plans to execute a function.

Memory is networked and activated by a small amount of information through visual system to visual working memory. We don't always notice small changes.

Multi component model:

Phonological loop
- holding acoustic or speech-based sequences
- articulatory rehearsal mechanism (e.g. remember license plate)
- left hemisphere
- possibly, important for chunking (breaking up verbal information into coherent phrases). - modality effect here.
- conversion from visual to verbal
- memory effects: rhyming causes confusion, and word length has an effect on recall.

Visua-spatial sketch pad - similar function for visual or spatially encoded items.
- right hemisphere
- separate what versus where mechanisms
- possibly, a third sub-system for action sequences

Central executive - attentionally limited system that selects and manipulates patterns / objects in the subsystems.
- planning, problem solving
- shifting & switching attention (when plan not working)
- fluency - ability to quickly and efficiently search for and generate new info
- inhibition - stop doing irrelevant actions
- keep goals in mind
- self-monitoring - check on progress

Episodic memory is a sub-system that:
- links LT memory
- integrates information from other sub-systems into a unified experience
- small area of storage capacity that does not depend on perceptual input.
- limit on "chunks of information" that can be bound together coherently
- Gives us the experience of current consciousness
- back up store to PSTM and VSSTM.

# Design considerations

- **Chunk information** (task & information structure)
- **Prime important concepts** (e.g., search icon in mobile apps, brands, concepts)
- **Use common schemas & frames** (e.g., shopping carts, landmarks for route finding)
- **Direct & sustain attention** using inherent interest in SEEKING and novelty
- **Coordinate messages across modalities**
 - Graphical symbols to convey conventional information (but consider cross-cultural effects)
 - Arrows to direct attention
 - Spatial organization to chunk and aid comprehension
 - Visual and linguistic concordance (tone of voice, font, colors, shapes, message)

"Retrieval is the process of recovering a target memory based on one or more cues" Baddeley

Name a fruit: banana versus guava. A guava is a fruit but has a weaker association to fruit.

Retrieval is a progression from one or more cues to a target memory via associative cnnections.

Many things serve as cues. We have a content addressable memory like Google (any content in memory can serve as a cue).

Retrieval spreads as via spreading activation. When something is in focus, it stimulates a trace. Higher levels of activation result in greater accessibility.

# Associative memory

.pull-left[
*"Composite memory of the sensory and motor activities related to the interaction between the organism and object during a certain period of time."*
Damasio, 2011, Self Comes to Mind, p. 133

- We perceive by engagement.
- To recall, we play back an approximation of a perception.
- Sensory areas can only create one sensory image at a time, but the PFC can hold the salient goal or goal-relevant features of several at a time. Reser, 2013

???

- sensorimotor patterns for viewing (eye, neck, head, body)
- sensorimotor patterns for touching & manipulation (hand, location)
- sensorimotor patterns from evocation of previous memories
- sensorimotor patterns related to trigger of emotions and feelings relative to the object

"Remembering a person or event or telling a story necessitates recall; recognizing objects and situations around us necessitates recall as well; so does thinking about objects with which we have interacted and about events we have perceived, and so does the entire imaginative process with which we plan for the future" Damasio, Self Comes to Mind, 2011, p. 136

Convergence zones marry two types of memory systems: dispositional and associative maps
- dispositions - reactivates network of past perceptions in image space. knowledgebase for reconstruction. implicit and unconscious memory.
- image space - explicit images that are both conscious and unconscious.
-

- Hierarchy of complexity (semantic/episodic or generic/contextual)
 - unique personal entities & events (most)
 - unique non-personal entities & events
 - non-unique entities & events

Experiment took place in an office kitchen with an
"honesty box". On the wall was a suggested price list for tea and coffee.  Above the price list, the researchers posted a new image each week for 10 weeks alternative between images of flowers and human eyes.

When staff were primed by seeing eyes above the price list, they paid almost three times as much as when they saw the flowers.

# Behavior is our medium
Robert Fabricant, Frog Design, 2009

???

The central business of interaction design concerns affecting and guiding behavior.

We've talked about some means for guiding attention, and sustaining attention. Now we're getting into the meat-and-potatoes of designing for behavior change.

# Dual Processing Theory

.center[![:scale 100%](images/brain2.png)]

???

System 1 - no effort, no sense of voluntary control
 - perception, recognition, orientation
 - learned associations
 - learned skills such as reading and social cues
System 2 - attention allocation, associated with subjective experience of agency, choice and concentration.

System 1 depends heavily on the limbic system - Visceral, autonomic processes. Includes the hippocampus, important to forming memories. Also includes the amygdala, important to emotional processes and basal ganglia connected to intentional movement. Heavily modulated by dopamine (neurotransmitter which plays a role in reward) - important to motivation and learning.

Faces are processed via support from the amygdala. The amygdala is involved in evaluating the trustworthiness of an individuals.  It also plays a role in the overall evaluation of first impressions of faces.

"We are blind to our blindness"

System 1 always suggests - if endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires.

System 2 activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. Or when System 1 does not have an answer.

and therefore takes more space in your working memory. This matters, because anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think.

# Cognitive ease

.center[![:scale 100%](images/cognitive-ease.png)]
???

cognitive ease associates with good feelings

familiarity - words you've seen before you will see more clearly [bolding]
consistency will also bias beliefs

"A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."

# Familiarity
<center>
### The body temperature of a chicken is...
.center[![:scale 100%](images/chicken.png)]

???

People who were repeatedly exposed to the phrase “the body temperature of a chicken” were more likely to accept as true the statement that “the body temperature of a chicken is 144 °” (or any other arbitrary number). The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true.

Zajonc

"The consequences of repeated exposures benefit the organism in its relations to the immediate animate and inanimate environment. They allow the organism to distinguish objects and habitats that are safe from those that are not, and they are the most primitive basis of social attachments. Therefore, they form the basis for social organization and cohesion— the basic sources of psychological and social stability."

# Design concepts (Kahneman)

- Simple language
- High quality paper to maximize contrast
- Bright blue or red more persuasive that green, yellow, or pale blue (culture sensitive)
- Make messages memorable
- Rhyming judged more insightful
- Choose a source to quote with a name easy to pronounce
- More frequent stimuli, more favorable perception
- Positive mood
- Priming, clear font, pre-exposed words
- Coherence

### Write down what happened

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/animating-anthropomorphism-giving-minds-to-geometric-shapes-video/

???
[Fritz Heider and Mary-Ann Simmel]

We intuit socially

"what kind of person is the big triangle?"

Write down what happened (cuing!)

We see literal, goal-directed (anthropomorphic actions) and attribute social behavior (feelings, motivations)

"Which leads to a chilling question. If it is so easy to imbue geometric shapes with human-like thoughts, feelings, intentions, and desires, how is it equally easy for some people to view others of their own species as decidedly non-human?" p. 76

# Linda Problem

Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.

Is Linda more likely to be a "(a) bank teller" or a "(b) bank teller and active in the feminist movement"?

Kahneman, 2011, Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 156)

???

Substitution

Humans naturally good at grammar but not at statistics. Mental models belong to System 1. We estimate probability based on on how easy it is to retrieve memories. Emotion-charged memories are easier to retrieve. Tend to over-estimate the probability of violent crime and under-estimate more benign statistics such as good works.

How is this useful?

- Is everything normal? Situations evaluated as good or bad. Good mood and cognitive ease are associated with feelings of safety and familiarity.

[Make the system familiar - not too much change]

Todorov - political campaign portraits. .1 seconds. rated on likability and competence. In 70% winners came from those
that were rated as more competent.

Very good at relative judgements - uses prototypes & exemplars.

Quantity irrelevant emotional context has a larger impact. Underlying dimension of intensity. We can do this across scales, as well.

mental shotgun (excess computation) combined with intensity matching makes it possible to have intuitive judgements about things that we know little about.
